# Etch-a-Sketch: A Project made with Flexbox, Javascript, HTML, and CSS

---

## Goals:

Following the [Assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch#assignment) here is what i have planned:  
- Use Javascript to make a grid of boxes (and let the user decide how many boxes)
- Use flexbox to organize them neatly
- Create a cozy and artsy UI with CSS
- Set a hover effect using Javascript events to draw over the boxes

Following [The Extra Credit](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch#extra-credit) here is what i have planned aswell:  
- Randomize RGB values of hovered boxes using Javascript
- Implement a progressive darkening effect

---

## Outcome:

With this project completed, I would have achieved a comfortable status with foundational Javascript and desigining capabilities.
